All programs Q2.py up to Q7.py are written in python in VSCode IDE.

All programs will be executable in an environment with numpy, matplotlib
and csv libraries installed e.g. VSCode or IDLE.

All programs must lie in the same folder, if they do not, there is
a possibility that the programs will break as there are dependencies.
